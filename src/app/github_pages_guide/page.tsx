          This guide will teach you how to deploy your own "home made" portfolio
          to an online web page. For hosting this page we will use Githubs
          "Github Pages", which is a service provided by Github to host your own
          web page on their servers. This comes with some limitations, but for
          the purpose of this course, and to deploy a portfolio, it works just
          fine. As you may or may not know we use Gitlab for development in
          Propulse, so why would we use Github now? Actually no particular
          reason. If you prefer Gitlab, there is an identical feature called
          Gitlab Pages that you can use. BUT I recommend not using you Propulse
          account, as you may want to use this portfolio after your time in
          Propulse :). I have a personal account on Github so thats why I chose
          it, and also it's not a bad thing to have experience with both
          websites.
          <br />
          <br />
          In terms of development, this project is purely frontend.
          Github/Gitlab Pages only support hosting of
          <i> static </i> web pages. That means no server-side processing is
          allowed (ex: no database :c). We will use React with Next.js for
          frontend, which is a widely used and modern componet based framework.
          The concept is to build resuable chunks of code to make development of
          more complex sites easier. We will also use a component library called
          Material UI to import prebuilt components. These kinds of libraries
          can save a lot of time, and are very easy to customize to your liking,
          as will be showed later. As for the programming language, Typescript
          is my preferred option. It is basically Javascript, but with type
          declaration to save yourself some confusing errors while developing.
          For styling, either css, scss, or tailwind can be used, but when using
          a component library I find that I rarely (or never) have a need for
          it.

          So why are we doing this? The main purpose of this course is for the
          members of DevOps to get hands on experience with web development, to
          practise use of frontend tools and to get used to Git-commands and
          repositories. This experience will come in handy during development of
          this years projects, and probably in the future as well.
          <br />
          Another benefit is that you are going to build an actual portfolio
          that comes in handy when applying for jobs. Of course there are
          websites nowadays that can do this for you, but it`s a much bigger
          flex to have built it yourself!

          A repository is an online version tracker of your application. We
          develop on a local version on our pc, and use git to keep the
          repository updated with new changes. It is essential when working
          together with others, as it allows each developer on a project to keep
          track of new changes. Start by creating the repository like this:

          Now, we want to store a local verison of the repository on our pc.
          This is done by <i> cloning </i> it to the pc`s storage. To clone a
          repository we use something called an SSH-key, which is an
          authentication tool for secure communication between our pc and remote
          servers. This is necessary to create a connection between the remote
          tory and our local one. The key is unique to your computer, and must
          be added to your Github profile. To check if you already have one
          click on your Profile icon &rarr; Settings &rarr; SSH and GPG keys.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you don`t, check if you have one genereated on your computer and
          possibly generate a new one

                    If you receive an error that ~/.ssh doesn't exist, you do
                    not have an existing SSH key pair in the default location.
                    You can create a new SSH key pair in the next step.

          As the name suggests this is a tool to manage which version of Node is
          used. It`s very useful for swapping between different versions,
          because once a project is made with one version, it may not be
          compatible with others (This itself is an annoying weakness of Node,
          but i`m willing to live with it). As for now, we can use it to install
          Node.

          Okay but what is Node? Honestly im not sure how to explain this,

          things. If you don't know what that means, don't worry it's not
          important for now. You can try to make sense of ChatGPTs response if

                it smoother and more compact (though I will argue way less

                reference other files, for exmaple when you want to import
                something from them. By default if you want to acces other files
                from a nested component, you would have to reference backwards
                like this "../../..", but with custom alias you can avoid this
                by setting up some rules. This is actually super useful, but I
                have chosen to not include it now because we need to focus on
                the important stuff first. Also, this can easily be configured
                after the project is made!

              Your now have a next.js project! The first thing you should do is
              to open the project in your code editor. Then make an initial
              commit to your repository. This is done by adding all files to the
              staging area, commiting them, and pushing them.
              <br />
              <br />
              You should now be able to see your project at you github pages
              url. It may only display the readme page, but we will fix that in
              the next segment.
              <br />

              Using the deployed website under development is impractical, as it
              takes a while to update. Instead, we want to start a development
              server with hot refresh so we can see all our changes in real
              time.
              <br />
              To start the development server, run this command, and then
              navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.

              You can now start developing your portfolio!

              page.tsx is the main file for the page you see when you navigate
              to the website. You can edit this file to change the content.
              <br />
              This guide wont go into detail on how to design your website, but
              there are plenty guides online or you can ask ChatGPT for help.

              You are now about to create a yml file that will automatically
              deploy your project to Github Pages. Press the green "Commit
              changes" button in the top right corner, and when a window pops
              up, press "Commit changes" again.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now you need to <b>pull</b> this change to your local repository.
              From now on, when you push changes to the repository, the updated
              project will automatically be deployed to Github Pages.
              <br />
              <br />
              Test this by making a small change to page.tsx, commiting it, and
              pushing it to the repository.
              <br />
              Go into the actions tab on guthub and see if the deployment is
              successful. It should look something like this:
